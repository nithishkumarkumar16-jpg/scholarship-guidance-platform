# NSP Coverage & Knowledge Base Audit Report (SGP)

## 1. Executive Summary

This document provides a factual, non-inflated accounting of the scholarships, document types, eligibility rules, and pre-submission consistency checks currently supported in the **Scholarship Guidance Platform (SGP) — NSP Readiness Module**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Boundary Notice:** SGP is a pre-submission readiness checker that detects preventable application and document errors. It does not independently authenticate government records, predict government decisions, or guarantee scholarship approval.

## 2. Scheme Knowledge Base Breakdown

Total Schemes in `src/knowledge/nspSchemes.js`: **11 schemes**
- **Verified (`VERIFIED`)**: **8 schemes** (Confirmed from current authoritative government sources)
- **Partially Verified (`PARTIALLY_VERIFIED`)**: **2 schemes** (Core rules verified; select current-year details pending official gazette update)

## 5. Pre-Submission Risk Checks (23 Audited Checks)

A risk check is a pre-submission consistency check — **NOT an automatic NSP rejection rule**. All 23 checks are classified into one of three distinct categories:

### Check Classification Summary

- **Universal Consistency Checks (`UNIVERSAL_CONSISTENCY_CHECK`)**: 8 checks (General consistency across student documents regardless of scheme)
- **Scheme-Specific Checks (`SCHEME_SPECIFIC_CHECK`)**: 11 checks (Evaluated strictly against the selected scheme's published rules)
- **Advisory Checks (`ADVISORY_CHECK`)**: 4 checks (Quality, scan clarity, and variance anomaly review flags)

### Detailed 23-Check Classification Matrix

| Check ID | Risk / Rule Name | Dimension | Severity | Classification | Description / Handling |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `IDENTITY_NAME_MISMATCH` | Student name mismatch across documents | Identity | `UNIVERSAL_CONSISTENCY_CHECK` | High attention; flags name variations between Aadhaar, 10th, 12th, and bonafide |

## 6. Official Product Positioning & Capability Boundaries

### Final Product Claim

> **"SGP helps students prepare for scholarship submission by checking eligibility information, document completeness, cross-document consistency, and common pre-submission issues before they submit through the official portal."**

### Explicit Boundary Disclaimers

1. **Do NOT claim SGP predicts NSP rejection**: SGP provides pre-submission risk checks and anomaly detection, not predictive rejection decisions.
2. **Do NOT claim SGP verifies government documents**: SGP inspects document clarity, consistency, and completeness offline. It does not connect to live government databases.
3. **Do NOT claim SGP guarantees NSP approval**: Final sanction and fund disbursement are strictly subject to official portal verification and quota limits.
4. **Do NOT claim all NSP scholarships are verified**: Only schemes audited against authoritative official gazettes are marked `VERIFIED`; others are marked `PARTIALLY_VERIFIED` or `UNVERIFIED`.
5. **No Live NPCI / UIDAI Connectivity**: SGP cannot verify real-time Aadhaar-bank seeding on the NPCI mapper. It provides guidance on how students can check status on `myaadhaar.uidai.gov.in`.
6. **State Rule Boundaries**: Tamil Nadu rules (G.O. Ms. No. 92 and G.O. Ms. No. 85) are strictly isolated and never leak into central or other state schemes.
